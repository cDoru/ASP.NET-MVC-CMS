FIXED:
- The UI for viewing an Event details needs to look better
- Added a static url e.g. "http://bing.com" to menu item "search" does not property setup the link.
- No details page for Feedback
- Deleting, Editing, Copying an entity that has just been deleted throws error.( Happens by 1. deleting, 2. go back in browser, 3. select entity )
- Comments should only have "delete" and "edit" feature. not "copy" feature
- Can not change email address on account in this version
- Post settings "pagesize" is not used
- Menu / pages are cached, so when adding/removing a menu item may not immediately be reflected in the menu.
- After creating a user account, the user can not go into the dashboard to change his account info.
- Roles based access needs to support when showing the dashboard.
- When creating a widget, the "IsActive" property must be set to true for it show up in the sidebars.
- Workflow for adding comment needs to be more elegant
- Page / Url loading seems a bit slow. Need to investigate if it's a url routing issue or my code or both.
  ( Due to RenderPartial calls in debug mode )
